Methodology...
After reading through twice, this seems to combine elements from the table and form labs from last week.. I will create a constructor that can be applied to all of the images in my img folder,

THEN I will need to create a random picture generator, perhaps the code will be similar to the "random cookie generator" but I will look into how the random effect has to append pictures randomly...

Perhaps use this random effect to then loop through the information and display the images, through an "imageGenerator" function...

Technical Plan.

html scaffold...
I would just make a basic website, but then just put the id="app" on a div that signals where my app will be created../

Create a constructor function that...
creates an object associated with each image,
with properties...
name,
filepath,
number of times it has been shown,
number of times it has been clicked..
PERHAPS a property that contains a text string you can use as an ID in HTML... (maybe just use name from above?)

log clicker...
  logs the amount of clicks.



Create a random image generator...
(Should I put this inside the above constructor or create a seperate method outside...?) (check both ways) (note that the function has to be called in order to use outside as its own method!...)

perhaps a random button generator...
  logs the clicks,


  So the end product of this method will...
  generate three unique images...
  count

create an appending function....
for loop that goes through the array of images...
yikes! These pictures will create buttons!



Animations Plan...
I will most likely be using a bar chart and some variation of pie charts to display my data, so I was thinking to keep the animations simple... I would use keyframe animations to perhaps slide in the different kinds of graphs, while taking away the last pictures displayed....

We also learned how to make a hamburger menu, so this would be a nice feature to add to switch between my barchart and pie chart!

I want to please a marketing team for data, so I don't want the animations to distract from the data. Yes I would like to create a meaningful user experience but I need to take heed to who needs this data! (being marketing analysts and an airline company.. etc)
